# Hi there, I'm Abed Nego 👋

## 🚀 Full-Stack Developer | Building High-Impact Solutions

I'm a **full-stack developer** with **4+ years of experience** turning ideas into production-ready applications. I specialize in creating tools and platforms that deliver immediate, measurable business value.

### 💡 What Drives Me

I build things that people can use **right away** – solutions where you can see the impact instantly. Whether it's streamlining a business process, launching an e-commerce platform, or automating workflows, I focus on creating real-world value.

I'm passionate about understanding the **core concepts** behind technologies, not just using them superficially. This deep understanding allows me to combine skills from different domains and create compound solutions that are greater than the sum of their parts.
